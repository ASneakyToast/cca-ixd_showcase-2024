listingDescription: "This installation creates a space that promotes reflection on mortality by providing a space for individuals to explore their perceptions of death, and facilitate a deeper understanding of it. It aims to foster a sense of continuity and renewal, illustrating how death integrates into the broader cycle of life, thereby providing people with comfort surrounding this natural progression. It cultivates communal dialogue, demystifying and destigmatizing the conversations surrounding this topic, and thus help alleviate the fear and isolation often associated with mortality."
