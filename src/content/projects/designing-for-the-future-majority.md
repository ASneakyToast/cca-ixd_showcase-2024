listingDescription: "Technology was envisioned to make the world better and more capable for everyone. Despite its best intentions, the digital divide is one of the most persistent concerns hindering impacted communities from using digital technologies safely and equitably to create new opportunities. This research study re-examines age as a contributing factor, supplementing existing literature to uncover barriers to seniorsâ€™ digital experiences and successful learning outcomes. The collective findings and ideas inform design practitioners in crafting more inclusive and equitable interactions for an increasingly elderly population and contribute to the overarching vision of bridging the digital divide."
