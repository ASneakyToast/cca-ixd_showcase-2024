From a young age I've enjoyed exploring my creative vision, and I often find myself absorbing other people's emotions without realizing, I wish to leverage this sensitivity to fuel my design ethos of "making life suck less", extending a positive impact through my design practice. I'm particularly interested in using the power of interactivity to create meaningful and enriching experiences that encourage reflection and foster connections.
