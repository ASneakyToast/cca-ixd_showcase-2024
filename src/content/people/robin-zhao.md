 I am currently studying and pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Interaction Design, from California College of The Arts in San Francisco. I am a creative and curious student, and always been fascinated by the intricate relationship between human emotions, creativity, and technology. Art and creativity are also two essential components of my identity.
